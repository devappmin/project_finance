## Term project 1 of Maching Learning 2025-1

In this project, you will train regression models to predict KOSPI. 

## Datasets
The [training dataset](data/kospi_train.csv) has KOSPI from 2019 to 2022. The [test dataset](data/kospi_test.csv) has KOSPI in 2023. See [load_data.ipynb](load_data.ipynb) to load the datasets.

## Part 1
Predict KOSPI of the next day using KOSPI of previous days. 

## Part 2
Use more features (any publicly available statistics of your choice) to improve your model.
